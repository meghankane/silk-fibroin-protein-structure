# silk-fibroin-protein-structure
Visualizing 2KHM, the C-terminal non-repetitive domain of the spider dragline silk protein for HTGAA week 4 protein design fundamentals.

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies
*use Python 3
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Jupyter Notebook
```
$ jupyter notebook
```

Use Jupyter notebook to visualize the **2KHM** protein, as studied in [A conserved spider silk domain acts as a molecular switch that controls fiber assembly](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08936) Hagn et al., Nature 2010.
